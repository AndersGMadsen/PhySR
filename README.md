# PhySR

Physics-informed deep super-resolution of spatiotemporal data

The paper is currently under review.


## System requirements

- Python 3.6.13
- [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) 1.6.0
- Other packages such as *Matplotlib, Numpy and Scipy* are also used

## Installtion guide


## Demo




## Dataset

We provide the codes for data generation used in this paper, including 2D and 3D Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion equations. They are coded in the high-order finite difference method. The initial conditions (ICs) are manually made by adding several initial disturbance at different locations. 

## Implementation

We show the the PhySR for 2D and 3D Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion equations in the folder **Code**.
